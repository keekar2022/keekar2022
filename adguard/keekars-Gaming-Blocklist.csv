! Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
! The entry is known to block Animal Crossing Home Designer's "Special design requests" system, although that system has been inactive since 2017.
! WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.

! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings → System → News Channel Settings → Nintendo News → Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! Believed to reduce the initial loading time of Wii Sports Club by several seconds
! Since no third-party Miiverse clients with console support are believed to be able to exist by now (January 2020), this entry is pretty much here to stay.
