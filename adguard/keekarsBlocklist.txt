! Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
! The entry is known to block Animal Crossing Home Designer's "Special design requests" system, although that system has been inactive since 2017.
! WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.

! Believed to reduce the initial loading time of Wii Sports Club by several seconds
! Since no third-party Miiverse clients with console support are believed to be able to exist by now (January 2020), this entry is pretty much here to stay.

! ——— Nintendo Switch ———
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings → System → News Channel Settings → Nintendo News → Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! ——— PlayStation 4 ———
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings → System → Automatic Downloads → Featured Content → Off.

! ——— PlayStation 2 ———
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There are multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, most of them with flimsy websites and uptime. Popular ones include PS2 Online and Bobz Entertainment. See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ for details.
! Any IP redirection entries for servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! ——— Xbox Series X/S ———
! I offer a €15 bounty to anyone who know how to remove the sponsored ads in the main menu, payable by PayPal.

! ——— Dreamcast ———
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! ——— Steam Machines / SteamOS / Steam ———
! To get rid of popup windows that promote new games in desktop mode, go to View → Settings → Interface → "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases."

! ——— Epic Games Store ———
! To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings → Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"

! Entry suggestions on GitHub would be much appreciated.
! Especially desired, since I don't own them: Sega Saturn, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Xbox (2001 model), GameCube (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_online_functionality#Supported_games), Game Boy Color/Advance (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mobile_System_GB#Access), PlayStation 1 (i-Mode adapter), Nintendo 64 (Randnet, Morita Shogi 64 modem), Nokia N-Gage
